    <h1> What We Do in Computer Science!</h1>
    <p> In computer science, we spend most of our time using code.org~! I have used code.org at home as a way to learn how to code with blockly (a coding language popular among beginners). This time, it's completely different! Not just the environment, but also the courses themselves</p>
