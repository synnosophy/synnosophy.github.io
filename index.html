    <h1> A Quick Get to Know Me!</h1>
    <p> Hello! My username is synnosophy, but you can call me Finn or Cloud (I don't really have a preference)! 
      <br> Some of my interests are K-pop, computer science, and anime. :)
      <br> I'm making this page to be able to introduce myself to new friends and to practice using html as well as css. I am currently learning to use these 2 during school, but I'm also trying to learn a bit more on my own as well!
    <br> 
      I hope this helped you get to know me a bit! </p>
